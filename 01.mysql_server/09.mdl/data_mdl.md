#0.importanct structs

```cpp
首先：enum_mdl_namespace 表示mdl_request的作用域，比如alter table操作，需要获取TABLE作用域。

然后：enum_mdl_duration 表示mdl_request的持久类型，比如alter table操作，类型是MDL_STATEMENT，即语句结束，就释放mdl锁。又比如autocommit=0；select 操作，类型是MDL_TRANSACTION，必须在显示的commit，才释放mdl锁。

最后：enum_mdl_type 表示mdl_request的lock类型，根据这个枚举类型，来判断是否兼容和互斥。

    Lists of all MDL tickets acquired by this connection.

    Lists of MDL tickets:
    ---------------------
    The entire set of locks acquired by a connection can be separated
    in three subsets according to their duration: locks released at
    the end of statement, at the end of transaction and locks are
    released explicitly.

    Statement and transactional locks are locks with automatic scope.
    They are accumulated in the course of a transaction, and released
    either at the end of uppermost statement (for statement locks) or
    on COMMIT, ROLLBACK or ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT (for transactional
    locks). They must not be (and never are) released manually,
    i.e. with release_lock() call.

    Tickets with explicit duration are taken for locks that span
    multiple transactions or savepoints.
    These are: HANDLER SQL locks (HANDLER SQL is
    transaction-agnostic), LOCK TABLES locks (you can COMMIT/etc
    under LOCK TABLES, and the locked tables stay locked), user level
    locks (GET_LOCK()/RELEASE_LOCK() functions) and
    locks implementing "global read lock".

    Statement/transactional locks are always prepended to the
    beginning of the appropriate list. In other words, they are
    stored in reverse temporal order. Thus, when we rollback to
    a savepoint, we start popping and releasing tickets from the
    front until we reach the last ticket acquired after the savepoint.

    Locks with explicit duration are not stored in any
    particular order, and among each other can be split into
    four sets:

    [LOCK TABLES locks] [USER locks] [HANDLER locks] [GLOBAL READ LOCK locks]

    The following is known about these sets:
    * GLOBAL READ LOCK locks are always stored last.
      This is because one can't say SET GLOBAL read_only=1 or
      FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK if one has locked tables. One can,
      however, LOCK TABLES after having entered the read only mode.
      Note, that subsequent LOCK TABLES statement will unlock the previous
      set of tables, but not the GRL!
      There are no HANDLER locks after GRL locks because
      SET GLOBAL read_only performs a FLUSH TABLES WITH
      READ LOCK internally, and FLUSH TABLES, in turn, implicitly
      closes all open HANDLERs.
      However, one can open a few HANDLERs after entering the
      read only mode.
    * LOCK TABLES locks include intention exclusive locks on
      involved schemas and global intention exclusive lock.

    @note The fact that we use read-write lock prefers readers here is
          important as deadlock detector won't work correctly otherwise.

          For example, imagine that we have following waiters graph:

                       ctxA -> obj1 -> ctxB -> obj1 -|
                        ^                            |

          and both ctxA and ctxB start deadlock detection process:

            ctxA read-locks obj1             ctxB read-locks obj2
            ctxA goes deeper                 ctxB goes deeper

          Now ctxC comes in who wants to start waiting on obj1, also
          ctxD comes in who wants to start waiting on obj2.

            ctxC tries to write-lock obj1   ctxD tries to write-lock obj2
            ctxC is blocked                 ctxD is blocked

          Now ctxA and ctxB resume their search:

            ctxA tries to read-lock obj2    ctxB tries to read-lock obj1

          If m_rwlock prefers writes (or fair) both ctxA and ctxB would be
          blocked because of pending write locks from ctxD and ctxC
          correspondingly. Thus we will get a deadlock in deadlock detector.
          If m_wrlock prefers readers (actually ignoring pending writers is
          enough) ctxA and ctxB will continue and no deadlock will occur.
