  A lock request and a granted metadata lock are represented by

  locks (tickets) is controlled within the MDL subsystem.

  MDL_request is a C structure, you don't need to call a constructor
  or destructor for it.

    We also mis-use this type of lock for open HANDLERs, since lock
    acquired by this statement has to be compatible with lock acquired
    by LOCK TABLES ... WRITE statement, i.e. SNRW (We can't get by by
    acquiring S lock at HANDLER ... OPEN time and upgrading it to SR
    lock for HANDLER ... READ as it doesn't solve problem with need
    to abort DML statements which wait on table level lock while having
    open HANDLER in the same connection).
    To avoid deadlock which may occur when SNRW lock is being upgraded to
    X lock for table on which there is an active S lock which is owned by
    thread which waits in its turn for table-level lock owned by thread
    performing upgrade we have to use thr_abort_locks_for_thread()
    facility in such situation.
    This problem does not arise for locks on stored routines as we don't
    use SNRW locks for them. It also does not arise when S locks are used
    during PREPARE calls as table-level locks are not acquired in this
    case.

    ignoring pending requests for exclusive locks. Intended for use in
    cases when we only need to access metadata and not data, e.g. when
    filling an INFORMATION_SCHEMA table.
    Since SH lock is compatible with SNRW lock, the connection that
    holds SH lock lock should not try to acquire any kind of table-level
    or row-level lock, as this can lead to a deadlock. Moreover, after
    acquiring SH lock, the connection should not wait for any other
