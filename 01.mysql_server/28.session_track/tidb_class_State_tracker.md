#1.class State_tracker

```cpp
/**
  State_tracker
  -------------
  An abstract class that defines the interface for any of the server's
  'session state change tracker'. A tracker, however, is a sub- class of
  this class which takes care of tracking the change in value of a part-
  icular session state type and thus defines various methods listed in this
  interface. The change information is later serialized and transmitted to
  the client through protocol's OK packet.

  Tracker system variables :-
  A tracker is normally mapped to a system variable. So in order to enable,
  disable or modify the sub-entities of a tracker, the user needs to modify
  the respective system variable either through SET command or via command
  line option. As required in system variable handling, this interface also
  includes two functions to help in the verification of the supplied value
  (ON_CHECK) and the updation (ON_UPDATE) of the tracker system variable,
  namely - check() and update().

class State_tracker
{
protected:
  /** Is tracking enabled for a particular session state type ? */
  bool m_enabled;

  /** Has the session state type changed ? */
  bool m_changed;
  
};
