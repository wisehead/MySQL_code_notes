#2. Lex\_input\_stream

```cpp
/**
  @brief This class represents the character input stream consumed during
  lexical analysis.

  In addition to consuming the input stream, this class performs some
  comment pre processing, by filtering out out of bound special text
  from the query input stream.
  Two buffers, with pointers inside each buffers, are maintained in
  parallel. The 'raw' buffer is the original query text, which may
  contain out-of-bound comments. The 'cpp' (for comments pre processor)
  is the pre-processed buffer that contains only the query text that
  should be seen once out-of-bound data is removed.
