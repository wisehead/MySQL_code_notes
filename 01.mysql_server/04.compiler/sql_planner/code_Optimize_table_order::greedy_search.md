/**
  Find a good, possibly optimal, query execution plan (QEP) by a greedy search.

    The search procedure uses a hybrid greedy/exhaustive search with controlled
    exhaustiveness. The search is performed in N = card(remaining_tables)
    steps. Each step evaluates how promising is each of the unoptimized tables,
    selects the most promising table, and extends the current partial QEP with
    that table.  Currenly the most 'promising' table is the one with least
    expensive extension.\

    There are two extreme cases:
    -# When (card(remaining_tables) < search_depth), the estimate finds the
    best complete continuation of the partial QEP. This continuation can be
    used directly as a result of the search.
    -# When (search_depth == 1) the 'best_extension_by_limited_search'
    consideres the extension of the current QEP with each of the remaining
    unoptimized tables.

    All other cases are in-between these two extremes. Thus the parameter
    'search_depth' controlls the exhaustiveness of the search. The higher the
    value, the longer the optimizaton time and possibly the better the
    resulting plan. The lower the value, the fewer alternative plans are
    estimated, but the more likely to get a bad QEP.

    All intermediate and final results of the procedure are stored in 'join':
    - join->positions     : modified for every partial QEP that is explored
    - join->best_positions: modified for the current best complete QEP
    - join->best_read     : modified for the current best complete QEP
    - join->best_ref      : might be partially reordered

    The final optimal plan is stored in 'join->best_positions', and its
    corresponding cost in 'join->best_read'.

  @note
    The following pseudocode describes the algorithm of 'greedy_search':

    @code
    procedure greedy_search
    input: remaining_tables
    output: pplan;
    {
      pplan = <>;
      do {
        (t, a) = best_extension(pplan, remaining_tables);
        pplan = concat(pplan, (t, a));
        remaining_tables = remaining_tables - t;
      } while (remaining_tables != {})
      return pplan;
    }

  @endcode
    where 'best_extension' is a placeholder for a procedure that selects the
    most "promising" of all tables in 'remaining_tables'.
    Currently this estimate is performed by calling
    'best_extension_by_limited_search' to evaluate all extensions of the
    current QEP of size 'search_depth', thus the complexity of 'greedy_search'
    mainly depends on that of 'best_extension_by_limited_search'.

  @par
    If 'best_extension()' == 'best_extension_by_limited_search()', then the
    worst-case complexity of this algorithm is <=
    O(N*N^search_depth/search_depth). When serch_depth >= N, then the
    complexity of greedy_search is O(N!).
    'N' is the number of 'non eq_ref' tables + 'eq_ref groups' which normally
    are considerable less than total numbers of tables in the query.

  @par
    In the future, 'greedy_search' might be extended to support other
    implementations of 'best_extension'.

  @par
    @c search_depth from Optimize_table_order controls the exhaustiveness
    of the search, and @c prune_level controls the pruning heuristics that
    should be applied during search.

  @param remaining_tables set of tables not included into the partial plan yet

  @return false if successful, true if error
