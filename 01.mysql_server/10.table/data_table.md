#1.TABLE_LIST

```cpp
/*
  Table reference in the FROM clause.

  These table references can be of several types that correspond to
  different SQL elements. Below we list all types of TABLE_LISTs with
  the necessary conditions to determine when a TABLE_LIST instance
  belongs to a certain type.

  1) table (TABLE_LIST::view == NULL)
     - base table
       (TABLE_LIST::derived == NULL)
     - subquery - TABLE_LIST::table is a temp table
       (TABLE_LIST::derived != NULL)
     - information schema table
       (TABLE_LIST::schema_table != NULL)
       NOTICE: for schema tables TABLE_LIST::field_translation may be != NULL
  2) view (TABLE_LIST::view != NULL)
     - merge    (TABLE_LIST::effective_algorithm == VIEW_ALGORITHM_MERGE)
           also (TABLE_LIST::field_translation != NULL)
     - tmptable (TABLE_LIST::effective_algorithm == VIEW_ALGORITHM_TMPTABLE)
           also (TABLE_LIST::field_translation == NULL)
  3) nested table reference (TABLE_LIST::nested_join != NULL)
     - table sequence - e.g. (t1, t2, t3)
       TODO: how to distinguish from a JOIN?
     - general JOIN
       TODO: how to distinguish from a table sequence?
     - NATURAL JOIN
       (TABLE_LIST::natural_join != NULL)
       - JOIN ... USING
         (TABLE_LIST::join_using_fields != NULL)
     - semi-join
       ;
