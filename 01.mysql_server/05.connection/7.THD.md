#2.class 

```cpp
/**
  @class Statement
  @brief State of a single command executed against this connection.

  One connection can contain a lot of simultaneously running statements,
  some of which could be:
   - prepared, that is, contain placeholders,
   - opened as cursors. We maintain 1 to 1 relationship between
     statement and cursor - if user wants to create another cursor for his
     query, we create another statement for it.
  To perform some action with statement we reset THD part to the state  of
  that statement, do the action, and then save back modified state from THD
  to the statement. It will be changed in near future, and Statement will
  be used explicitly.
