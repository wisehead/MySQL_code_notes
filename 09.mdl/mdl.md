#1.MDL_request::init

```cpp
caller:
--init_one_table


/**
  Initialize a lock request.

  This is to be used for every lock request.

  Note that initialization and allocation are split into two
  calls. This is to allow flexible memory management of lock
  requests. Normally a lock request is stored in statement memory
  (e.g. is a member of struct TABLE_LIST), but we would also like
  to allow allocation of lock requests in other memory roots,
  for example in the grant subsystem, to lock privilege tables.

  The MDL subsystem does not own or manage memory of lock requests.

  @param  mdl_namespace  Id of namespace of object to be locked
  @param  db             Name of database to which the object belongs
  @param  name           Name of of the object
  @param  mdl_type       The MDL lock type for the request.
