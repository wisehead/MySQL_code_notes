#1.struct wbuf
```cpp
/* When serializing a value, write it into a buffer. */
/* This code requires that the buffer be big enough to hold whatever you put into it. */
/* This abstraction doesn't do a good job of hiding its internals.
 * Why?  The performance of this code is important, and we want to inline stuff */
//Why is size here an int instead of DISKOFF like in the initializer?
struct wbuf {
    unsigned char *buf;
    unsigned int  size;
    unsigned int  ndone;
    struct x1764  checksum;    // The checksum state
};
