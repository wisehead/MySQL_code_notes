#1.MACRO OS_FILE_LOG_BLOCK_SIZE


```cpp
/** The next value should be smaller or equal to the smallest sector size used
on any disk. A log block is required to be a portion of disk which is written
so that if the start and the end of a block get written to disk, then the
whole block gets written. This should be true even in most cases of a crash:
if this fails for a log block, then it is equivalent to a media failure in the
log. */

#define OS_FILE_LOG_BLOCK_SIZE      512
