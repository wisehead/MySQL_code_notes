#1. toku_logger_fsync_if_lsn_not_fsynced

```cpp
 770 // Effect: If fsync is nonzero, then make sure that the log is flushed and synced at least up to lsn.
 771 // Entry: Holds input lock iff 'holds_input_lock'.  The log entry has already been written to the input buffer.
 772 // Exit:  Holds no locks.
 773 // The input lock may be released and then reacquired.  Thus this function does not run atomically with respect to other threads.
