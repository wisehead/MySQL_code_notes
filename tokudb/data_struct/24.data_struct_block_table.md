#1. block_table

```cpp
/**
 *  There are three copies of the translation table (btt) in the block table:
 *
 *    checkpointed   Is initialized by deserializing from disk,
 *                   and is the only version ever read from disk.
 *                   When read from disk it is copied to current.
 *                   It is immutable. It can be replaced by an inprogress btt.
 *
 *    inprogress     Is only filled by copying from current,
 *                   and is the only version ever serialized to disk.
 *                   (It is serialized to disk on checkpoint and clean
 *shutdown.)
 *                   At end of checkpoint it replaces 'checkpointed'.
 *                   During a checkpoint, any 'pending' dirty writes will update
 *                   inprogress.
 *
 *    current        Is initialized by copying from checkpointed,
 *                   is the only version ever modified while the database is in
 *use,
 *                   and is the only version ever copied to inprogress.
 *                   It is never stored on disk.
